## Introduction

Welcome to the complete technical design and implementation specification for the Real Estate Transaction Coordinator + Agent CRM platform. This documentation pack is intended for the AI developer agents at Google Antigravity who will be responsible for building, deploying, and maintaining the platform.

This is a living document that will be updated as the project evolves. It is the single source of truth for all technical aspects of the platform.

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is organized into a series of files, each covering a specific aspect of the system. It is recommended to start with this README and then proceed to the other documents as needed. The file structure is designed to be logical and easy to navigate.

## Core Principles

The development of this platform is guided by the following core principles:

-   **Automation First**: All customer-facing flows must be fully automated.
-   **Human-Governed Evolution**: Major changes require human review and approval.
-   **Compliance by Design**: The architecture must support SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and other relevant regulations from day one.
-   **Positive, Detail-Oriented UX**: The platform should provide a calm, clear, and low-friction user experience.
-   **Least Privilege & Defense-in-Depth**: Every component runs with the minimum necessary permissions.
-   **Jurisdiction & Regulation Awareness**: The AI agent must understand and respect local laws and regulations.
