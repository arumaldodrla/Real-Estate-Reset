# GDPR and Data Subject Rights

This document outlines the platform's approach to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the procedures for handling Data Subject Rights (DSR) requests.

## 1. Data Controller and Data Processor

-   **Data Controller**: For the data related to the end customers interacting with the chatbot, the real estate agent or brokerage (the platform's customer) is the Data Controller.
-   **Data Processor**: The platform acts as a Data Processor on behalf of its customers.
-   **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)**: A DPA will be made available to all customers to formalize the data processing relationship.

## 2. Lawful Basis for Processing

The primary lawful basis for processing end customer data is the legitimate interest of the Data Controller (the agent or brokerage) to engage with potential clients and market their services.

## 3. International Data Transfers

-   **Data Residency**: The platform will offer data residency options, allowing customers to store their data in specific geographic regions (e.g., EU, US) to comply with data sovereignty requirements.
-   **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**: For any transfers of data from the EU to other regions, SCCs will be in place with all sub-processors (e.g., AI service providers, infrastructure hosts).

## 4. Data Subject Rights

The platform will provide APIs and internal procedures to support the following Data Subject Rights:

-   **Right to Access**: A user can request a copy of all their personal data. For an end customer, this would include the full history of their chatbot conversations.
-   **Right to Rectification**: A user can request the correction of inaccurate personal data.
-   **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: A user can request the deletion of their personal data. This will involve anonymizing their chatbot conversations and deleting their personal information from the platform's database.
-   **Right to Data Portability**: A user can request their data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (e.g., JSON).

## 5. Consent Management

-   **Chatbot Transparency**: The AI Property Agent will clearly disclose that it is an AI and that the conversation may be logged.
-   **Opt-in**: Where required, the platform will obtain explicit opt-in consent for activities like marketing communications.
