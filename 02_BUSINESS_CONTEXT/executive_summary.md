# Executive Summary

## Vision

To become the operating system for real estate teams—combining transaction coordination, agent CRM, and AI-powered customer engagement in a single platform that reduces friction, increases productivity, and scales revenue for brokerages and independent agents.

## The Opportunity

The real estate industry is highly fragmented, with coordinators and agents spending 40% of their time managing email, deadlines, and document chaos rather than selling. Simultaneously, real estate agencies struggle to engage prospective buyers across modern communication channels (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram) without manual intervention.

**Market Size:**
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** $1.2–1.8B globally
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** $350M–500M (US + Canada focus, Years 1–3)
- **Target Customer:** Mid-market brokerages (5–20 agents), transaction coordinators, and independent agents

**Path to $1M ARR:** Month 17 (16–18 months from launch)

## What We're Building

A **three-layer platform** that solves real estate's biggest pain points:

1. **Layer 1: Transaction Coordination** – Automate deadline management, document workflows, and party communication
2. **Layer 2: Agent CRM** – Give agents visibility into pipeline, commissions, and customer relationships
3. **Layer 3: AI Property Chatbot** – Enable brokerages to engage customers via WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and websites with intelligent property recommendations powered by property data (MLS, Zillow, manual listings) and local regulations

## Competitive Advantage

- **Code Reuse:** 40% reuse from existing Freelancer product (Refine + Supabase + Zoho infrastructure)
- **Exceptional Unit Economics:** LTV:CAC ratio of **68x** (industry-leading)
- **AI-First:** Property recommendation engine with regulatory compliance baked in
- **Multi-Channel Native:** WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, website widget—all in one platform
